# Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project that I contributed to as part of a team of three friends in July 2022. The project was created as a selection task for the Compfest 2022 bootcamp at Universitas Indonesia, and my main responsibility was in the modelling part. The aim of the project was to build a LSTM model for time series forecasting on societies mobility in relation to the impact of COVID-19.

## Motivation
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted societies worldwide, affecting various areas such as mobility. The purpose of this project was to develop a LSTM model to predict how mobility patterns would change over time in response to COVID-19, which could be useful for policymakers and others who are working to manage the impact of the pandemic.

## Modelling
My main task in this project was in the modelling part, where I developed the LSTM model to predict future mobility patterns based on historical data. I trained the model on a subset of the available data and evaluated its performance using various metrics. I also made adjustments to the model as necessary to improve its accuracy.

## Results
The results of the LSTM model showed that it was effective in predicting mobility patterns over time, with a high degree of accuracy. The model's predictions could be used to inform policymakers and others who are working to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on societies. The project team documented their process and findings in detail, which could be useful for others who are interested in using LSTM modeling for time series forecasting.
