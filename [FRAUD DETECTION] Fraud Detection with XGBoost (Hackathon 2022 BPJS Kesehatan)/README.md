# BPJS Kesehatan Healthkathon 2022 Machine Learning Category (3rd Place)

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project that I contributed to as part of a team called "The JamMaths". In October 2022, our team was named the 3rd winner in the Healthkathon 2022 Machine Learning Category. The aim of the project was to build a classification model for the inefficiency of BPJS Kesehatan participant claims, specifically focusing on fraud detection using XGBoost.

## Motivation
Fraud in healthcare claims is a critical issue that can significantly impact healthcare providers and patients. Our goal was to develop a classification model to identify fraudulent claims among BPJS Kesehatan participants, which would help mitigate losses and ensure that genuine claims are processed promptly.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contained around 11 million records and 22 features that were not cleaned, making it a challenging problem for our team. We pre-processed and cleaned the data before building the classification model, which helped to ensure that the model's predictions were as accurate as possible.

## Modelling
Our team built a classification model using XGBoost to predict whether a claim is fraudulent or not. We trained the model on a subset of the available data and evaluated its performance using various metrics. We made adjustments to the model as necessary to improve its accuracy and performance.

## Results
Our team's model was named the 3rd winner in the Healthkathon 2022 Machine Learning Category. The model's predictions showed a high degree of accuracy in identifying fraudulent claims among BPJS Kesehatan participants. The project team documented their process and findings in detail, which could be useful for others who are interested in building classification models for fraud detection in healthcare claims.
