# Data Science Lab Assistant Experience

## Introduction
As a data science class laboratory assistant, I created two modules to help students learn important concepts and tools in data science. The first module focuses on data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib, while the second module covers deep neural networks with TensorFlow-Keras and hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner.

## Motivation
The motivation for creating these modules was to provide students with practical, hands-on experience using popular data science tools. Many students have theoretical knowledge of these tools, but lack experience using them to solve real-world problems. By providing these modules, I aimed to bridge that gap and help students gain valuable experience and skills that they can apply in their future careers.

## Data Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
In the first module, I provided students with an introduction to data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The module covered basic plotting techniques, such as line plots, scatter plots, and histograms, as well as more advanced techniques, such as heatmaps and box plots. Students also learned how to customize their plots using various parameters, such as color, size, and labels.

## Deep Neural Networks with TensorFlow-Keras and Hyperparameter Tuning with Keras Tuner
In the second module, I introduced students to deep neural networks using TensorFlow-Keras. The module covered the basics of neural networks, including activation functions, layers, and loss functions. Students also learned how to train and evaluate neural networks using real-world datasets. To further enhance their skills, students were also taught how to optimize hyperparameters using Keras Tuner, a powerful tool for hyperparameter tuning.

## Conclusion
As a data science class laboratory assistant, I created two modules that provide students with practical, hands-on experience using popular data science tools. By teaching students how to use these tools to solve real-world problems, I aimed to help them gain valuable experience and skills that they can apply in their future careers.
