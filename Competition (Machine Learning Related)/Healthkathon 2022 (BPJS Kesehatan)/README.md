# BPJS Kesehatan Healthkathon 2022 Machine Learning Category (3rd Place)

In October 2022, my team, called "The JamMaths", managed to be the 3rd winner of Healthkathon 2022 Machine Learning Category. 
My team build a classification model for inefficiency of BPJS Kesehatan participant claims (fraud detection), using XGBoost.

In the given dataset, there are around 11 million of records and 22 features that have not been cleaned, which is a very challenging problem for us. But, we've managed to be 
the top 3 out of over 500 teams spread all over Indonesia.

In this repository, there are two files that my team has submitted in this competition, one (.ipynb file) is the ipython notebook which is our whole work, and the other one (.pdf
file) is the presentation file that we've presented at the final phase.
