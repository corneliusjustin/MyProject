# Sentiment Analysis and Topic Detection on Tweets about ChatGPT in March 2023

## Introduction
This project was completed as a team consisted of four members, and we used Python as the programming language. Our task was to perform sentiment analysis and topic detection on tweets about ChatGPT, a powerful AI chatbot, in March 2023.

## Motivation
ChatGPT is an AI chatbot that can understand and generate natural human language with sophistication, sensitivity, and multi-functionality. It can answer complex questions, provide solutions, write code, and create stories. This project aims to analyze the public opinions and interests about ChatGPT using Twitter data.

## Data
The dataset for this project consisted of two parts: the training data and the prediction data. The training data contained tweets about ChatGPT in December 2022 with sentiment labels (bad, good, neutral). The prediction data contained tweets about ChatGPT in March 2023 without labels. Both datasets were obtained from Kaggle.

## Methodology
We used two main methods for this project: sentiment analysis and topic detection. For sentiment analysis, we implemented a deep learning model using Keras with TensorFlow backend. The model consisted of an embedding layer, a bidirectional LSTM layer, a convolutional layer, a dropout layer, and a dense layer. We used Bayesian search to tune the hyperparameters of the model.

For topic detection, we used BERTopic, a neural topic modeling technique that uses clustering and class-based TF-IDF to generate coherent topic representationsÂ¹[1]. We used Sentence-BERT to convert the documents into embeddings, UMAP to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings, HDBSCAN to cluster the reduced embeddings, and class-based TF-IDF to extract the topic words. We used grid search to tune the hyperparameters of BERTopic.

## Results
We evaluated the performance of our methods using different metrics. For sentiment analysis, we used F1-score and accuracy to measure the model's ability to predict the sentiment labels of the test set. The model achieved an F1-score of 89% for good sentiment, 79% for neutral sentiment, and 93% for bad sentiment. The overall accuracy was 88%.

For topic detection, we used coherence score to measure the quality of the topics generated by BERTopic. The coherence score was 0.194, which indicated a moderate level of coherence. BERTopic identified 19 topics from the prediction data, each represented by 10 words. The most frequent topic was about ChatGPT's latest model, GPT-4. The most positive topic was about new technologies for software development. The most negative topic was about cyber security risks during the pandemic.
